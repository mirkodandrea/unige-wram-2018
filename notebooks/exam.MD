Further notes about "risk  mapping type"  exam for WRAM.


- the students  can be split into groups if convenient
- the student may  use the notebooks or try  installing their own python packages
- Database of Sicily and  Sardinia  shall be uploaded soon.

A good  workflow for  the  exam may be  the subsequent:

-- Clean up of  the database(s)
-- Choice of the algorithm
-- Modifying the database to create a valid input to the algorithm
-- Launch of the algorithm
-- Plot of the results into a map and discussion of the result.
-- File a report about the work done and prepare an  oral presentation.
